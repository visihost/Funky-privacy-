**Privacy Policy for Funky Music Bot**

Effective Date: [14th march, 2024]

Funky Music Bot ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your data while you interact with Funky Music Bot on Discord.

 **1. Data Collection**
Funky Music Bot only collects and processes data that is necessary to provide our services. This data includes:

- **Message Content:** We process message content solely to respond to user commands (e.g., `+play`, `+skip`). We do not store or log message content after the command is processed.
- **Presence Data:** If enabled, we track user presence (whether a user is online or idle) to provide dynamic music experiences, such as automatically pausing music when all users leave a voice channel. This data is used temporarily and not stored off-platform.
- **Server Member Data:** We may use server member data to personalize music experiences (e.g., playing personalized welcome tracks for new members), but this data is also not stored beyond the session.

**2. How We Use Your Data**
We use the collected data only for the following purposes:

- **Processing Commands:** We process user commands to control music playback, manage playlists, and execute other bot functions.
- **Enhancing User Experience:** We use presence data to optimize music playback based on server activity, such as auto-pausing music when no users are active.
- **Personalization:** We may provide custom greetings or music suggestions based on your activity within the server, but no personal information is stored or shared.

**3. Data Retention**
Funky Music Bot does not store any data permanently. All data collected, such as message content or presence data, is processed in real-time and discarded immediately after use. We do not retain or share any message content outside of Discord.

 **4. Data Security**
We implement reasonable security measures to protect the data we collect during active sessions. All data is processed in compliance with Discord’s Developer Terms of Service and API Guidelines. We do not store user data on external platforms, and your privacy is of the utmost importance to us.

**5. User Rights**
You have the right to:

- **Opt-Out of Specific Features:** If you prefer not to have your presence or message content data tracked, you can avoid interacting with the bot or configure your Discord settings to limit the bot's access to your information.
- **Request Data Deletion:** Since Funky Music Bot does not store user data, there is no data retained for deletion. However, if you have any concerns about your privacy, feel free to reach out to us.

 **6. Third-Party Services**
Funky Music Bot does not share any user data with third-party services. We only process data within Discord to deliver music and related services. We do not use message content data for training machine learning or AI models.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be communicated to users, and the updated policy will be available here. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your data.
